My name is William Eiers, and I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey. I work in software engineering and software verification, developing tools and approaches for automatically verifying software, particularly in compute clouds (AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure).

During my Ph.D., I focused on using quantitative techniques for verifying and repairing access control policies for the cloud. I am currently investigating how Generative AI (large language models) can be used in software verification and software engineering.

**I am always looking to hire bright and motivated graduate students to work with me at Stevens!** If you are interested, please send me an email with your C.V. and short bio.
